# Jenkins-HockeyApp-Appium-ReactNative
Guidance on integrating Kobiton service into the build pipeline of mobile app development: Jenkins, HockeyApp, Appium and ReactNative

If you are a company with a domain, ex: https://awesome-mapp.com and you use:

- Jenkins to build the app
- HockeyApp for keeping the daily app build
- Appium to write the automation test
- ReactNative to write app

The guidelines in this repo will show you how to trigger a Jenkins build from a push on GitHub (i.e. everytime a change is made to your source code), and how to run automation tests with Kobiton. 

## Contents
1. First guide will demonstrate [how to trigger a Jenkins build from a push to GitHub](./1-triggering-jenkins.md).
